# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Next Level Week participation starts. Creation of files, settings, creation of HTML, TSX, CSS and React.

**Thoughts:** The goal is to create a web app as if it were a portfolio of freelancers. But, in this case, it would only be available teachers to teach.
